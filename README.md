# Creative_Growth
Based on a survey of artists from Oakland's Creative Growth Studio, this project looks to define which resources are most useful for the artists.

## How to use
Going into artist_survey_data.csv, you can find the cleaned dataset that was used to make the presentation. I left the cleaning process out because the data contained a lot of personally identifiable information, and I wanted to maintain the artists' privacy. In this file, I added a few columns to make analyzing and parsing out a bit easier, as well as to generate a few completing statistics for the team at Creative Growth. There is a lot of interesting data in here that I plan to go back and dive into a bit more.

Once you have gotten a chance to look at the data, you can see what kind of findings I discovered in the Language and Technology Survey Findings.pdf. This was meant to be exploratory so as to give the team at Creative Growth something to cite when looking for more funding, as well as a way to verify things they had been suspecting regarding their supports. The sample is pretty small, so determining the power of it doesn't make a ton of sense. However, the survey was completed by almost all of the artists, so there is no need for generalizing. Any findings here are direct representations of the population of artists at Creative Growth.

Enjoy!
